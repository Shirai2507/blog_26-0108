# Repository Guidelines

## Agent Log

- Added `AGENTS.md` to document repository guidelines for contributors.

- Implemented Phase 2 markdown ingestion (frontmatter), post listing, date formatting, and sample posts.
- Implemented Phase 3 post detail route and minimal markdown rendering.
- Implemented Phase 4 TOC generation, heading anchors, and sidebar TOC highlighting.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `app/` contains the Next.js App Router source (e.g., `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`) and global styles in `app/globals.css`.
- `public/` stores static assets served at the site root (e.g., `/next.svg`).
- `.next/` is a build output directory generated by Next.js; do not edit or commit its contents.
- Root config files include `next.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, and `tsconfig.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: start the local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with fast refresh.
- `npm run build`: create a production build in `.next/`.
- `npm run start`: run the production build locally (after `npm run build`).
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint using the Next.js + TypeScript config.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript is enabled with `strict: true`; prefer typed props and explicit return types for exported helpers.
- Follow App Router file conventions: `app/page.tsx` for pages, `app/layout.tsx` for layouts, and route segments as folders (e.g., `app/blog/page.tsx`).
- Use standard React/TypeScript naming: components in `PascalCase`, hooks in `useSomething`, CSS classes in `kebab-case`.
- Formatting is enforced via ESLint; run `npm run lint` before submitting changes.

## Testing Guidelines

- No test framework is configured yet. If adding tests, prefer `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx` and document the runner in `package.json`.
- Keep UI-facing tests close to features (e.g., `app/components/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`) and include a short README note when introducing a new tool.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Git history currently contains only an initial commit; no formal commit convention is established.
- Use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add hero section", "Fix header spacing").
- PRs should include: a short summary, linked issue (if any), and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration & Environment Tips

- Node/npm are assumed; dependencies are locked in `package-lock.json`.
- Avoid committing secrets or local env files; add new environment variables to documentation as needed.
